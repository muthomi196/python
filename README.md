The script will create a new file named `my_file.txt` in the same directory, write three lines of text to the file, read the contents of the file and display them on the console, append three additional lines of text to the file, and handle potential file-related exceptions.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`.
